    "DET (Detection Error Tradeoff) curves and ROC (Receiver Operating Characteristic) curves are both graphical tools used to evaluate the performance of binary classification models. However, they present the information in slightly different ways and are often used in different contexts:\n",
    "\n",
    "**ROC Curve:**\n",

    "- **Focus:** Analyzes the trade-off between the True Positive Rate (TPR) and the False Positive Rate (FPR).\n",
    "- **Axes:**\n",
    "  - X-axis: False Positive Rate (FPR) - Proportion of negative examples incorrectly classified as positive.\n",
    "  - Y-axis: True Positive Rate (TPR) - Proportion of positive examples correctly classified as positive.\n",
    "- **Ideal Curve:** A perfect classifier would have an ROC curve that hugs the top-left corner, indicating a 100% TPR (all positive examples classified correctly) with a 0% FPR (no negative examples classified incorrectly).\n",
    "- **Applications:** Widely used in various classification tasks, including medical diagnosis, anomaly detection, and spam filtering.\n",

    "**DET Curve:**\n",

    "- **Axes:**\n",
    "  - X-axis: False Acceptance Rate (FAR) - Proportion of negative examples incorrectly classified as positive (same as FPR in ROC).\n",
    "  - Y-axis: False Rejection Rate (FRR) - Proportion of positive examples incorrectly classified as negative (1 - TPR from ROC).\n",
    "- **Ideal Curve:** A perfect classifier would have a DET curve that goes through the origin (0% FAR and FRR).\n",
    "- **Applications:** More commonly used in specific domains like speaker identification/verification or anomaly detection where minimizing both false rejections and false acceptances is crucial.\n",

    "- If you're dealing with a general classification problem where maximizing true positives while minimizing false positives is the primary concern, a **ROC curve** is a good choice.\n",
    "- If your application prioritizes minimizing both false rejections (missing true positives) and false acceptances (incorrectly identifying negatives), a **DET curve** might be more appropriate. This is often the case in security or verification systems.\n",
