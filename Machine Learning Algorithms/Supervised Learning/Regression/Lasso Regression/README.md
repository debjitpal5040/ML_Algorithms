# Lasso Regression

**Lasso Regression**, also known as **Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator**, is a type of linear regression that includes a regularization term. The regularization term is the L1 norm of the coefficients (the sum of the absolute values of the coefficients), which discourages large coefficients in the model to prevent overfitting. Unlike Ridge Regression, which tends to reduce all coefficients evenly, Lasso Regression can reduce some coefficients to zero, effectively excluding them from the model. This property makes Lasso Regression useful for feature selection in models with a large number of features. The formula for Lasso Regression is:

$$\min_{\beta} \left\{ \sum_{i=1}^{n} (y_i - \beta_0 - \sum_{j=1}^{p} \beta_j x_{ij})^2 + \lambda \sum_{j=1}^{p} |\beta_j| \right\}$$

where $y_i$ is the response variable, $\beta_0$ is the intercept, $\beta_j$ are the coefficients, $x_{ij}$ are the predictor variables, and $\lambda$ is the tuning parameter. The first part of the formula is the residual sum of squares, and the second part is the penalty term. The goal is to minimize this equation.

The term "L1" in L1 regularization refers to the **L1 norm** of the coefficient vector, which is used in the penalty term of the loss function. The L1 norm of a vector is the sum of the absolute values of the vector elements.

In the context of L1 regularization, the regularization term in the loss function is 位 times the L1 norm of the coefficient vector. This has the effect of penalizing large coefficients, which can help to prevent overfitting by discouraging complexity in the model. The 位 parameter controls the strength of the regularization: a larger 位 results in stronger regularization and a simpler model, while a smaller 位 results in weaker regularization and a more complex model.

The reason it's called "L1" regularization is because it uses the "L1" norm in the penalty term. Similarly, "L2" regularization uses the "L2" norm (or square of it) in the penalty term. These are two different ways of measuring the size of the coefficients, and they result in different properties in the regularized models. For example, L1 regularization can result in sparse models where some coefficients are exactly zero, while L2 regularization tends to result in models where all coefficients are small but non-zero.
