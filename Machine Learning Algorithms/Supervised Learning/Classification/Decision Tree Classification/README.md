# Decision Tree Classification

A decision tree is a supervised learning technique that can be used for classification problems. It splits the data into smaller and smaller subsets based on the values of certain attributes, and creates a tree-like structure where each node represents a test or a decision, and each leaf represents an outcome or a class label. The algorithm starts from the root node and follows the branches until it reaches a leaf node, which gives the predicted class for a new example. Decision trees are easy to understand, interpret and visualize, but they can also suffer from overfitting, instability and poor generalization.
