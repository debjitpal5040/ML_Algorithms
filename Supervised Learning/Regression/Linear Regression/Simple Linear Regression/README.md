# Simple Linear Regression
Simple Linear Regression is a type of Regression algorithms that models the relationship between a dependent variable and a single independent variable. The relationship shown by a Simple Linear Regression model is linear or a sloped straight line, hence it is called Simple Linear Regression.

The key point in Simple Linear Regression is that the <b>dependent variable must be a continuous/real value</b>. However, the independent variable can be measured on continuous or categorical values.

Simple Linear regression algorithm has mainly two objectives:

1.  <b>Model the relationship between the two variables.</b> Such as the relationship between Income and expenditure, experience and Salary, etc.
2.  <b>Forecasting new observations.</b> Such as Weather forecasting according to temperature, Revenue of a company according to the investments in a year, etc.

## Simple Linear Regression Model

The Simple Linear Regression model can be represented using the below equation:

y = a<sub>0</sub> + a<sub>1</sub>x + ε 


a<sub>0</sub> = It is the intercept of the Regression line (can be obtained putting x=0)<br>
a<sub>1</sub> = It is the slope of the regression line, which tells whether the line is increasing or decreasing. <br>
ε = The error term. (For a good model it will be negligible)
