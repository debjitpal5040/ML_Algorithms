# Linear Regression

In statistics, <b>linear regression</b> is a linear approach to modelling the relationship between a scalar response and one or more explanatory variables (also known as dependent and independent variables). The case of one explanatory variable is called <b>simple linear regression</b>; for more than one, the process is called <b>multiple linear regression</b>. 
<br>These are implementations of Simple and Multiple Linear Regression.
