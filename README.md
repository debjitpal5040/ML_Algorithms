This is a repository for Machine Learning Algorithms. It contains python codes in jupyter notebook and documentations of some of the ML algorithms.

## Machine Learning
Machine learning is about extracting knowledge from the data. It can be defined as, <i>"Machine learning is a subfield of artificial intelligence, which enables machines to learn from past data or experiences without being explicitly programmed"</i>.

Machine learning enables a computer system to make predictions or take some decisions using historical data without being explicitly programmed. Machine learning uses a massive amount of structured and semi-structured data so that a machine learning model can generate accurate result or give predictions based on that data.

Machine learning works on algorithm which learn by it's own using historical data. It works only for specific domains such as if we are creating a machine learning model to detect pictures of dogs, it will only give result for dog images, but if we provide a new data like cat image then it will become unresponsive. Machine learning is being used in various places such as for online recommender system, for Google search algorithms, Email spam filter, Facebook Auto friend tagging suggestion, etc.

It can be divided into three types:

    1. Supervised learning
    2. Unsupervised learning
    3. Reinforcement learning
