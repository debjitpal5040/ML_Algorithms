This is a repository for Machine Learning Algorithms. It contains python codes in jupyter notebook and documentations of some of the ML algorithms.

## Machine Learning
Machine learning is about extracting knowledge from the data. It can be defined as, <i>"Machine learning is a subfield of artificial intelligence, which enables machines to learn from past data or experiences without being explicitly programmed"</i>.

A Machine Learning system learns from historical data, builds the prediction models, and whenever it receives new data, predicts the output for it. The accuracy of predicted output depends upon the amount of data, as the huge amount of data helps to build a better model which predicts the output more accurately.

Machine learning works on algorithm which learn by it's own using historical data. It works only for specific domains such as if we are creating a machine learning model to detect pictures of dogs, it will only give result for dog images, but if we provide a new data like cat image then it will become unresponsive. Machine learning is being used in various places such as for online recommender system, for Google search algorithms, Email spam filter, Facebook Auto friend tagging suggestion, etc.

## Features of Machine Learning

    1. Machine learning uses data to detect various patterns in a given dataset.
    2. It can learn from past data and improve automatically.
    3. It is a data-driven technology.
    4. Machine learning is much similar to data mining as it also deals with the huge amount of the data.

## Classification of Machine Learning

At a broad level, machine learning can be classified into three types:

    1. Supervised learning
    2. Unsupervised learning
    3. Reinforcement learning

### Supervised Learning
Supervised learning is a type of machine learning method in which we provide sample labeled data to the machine learning system in order to train it, and on that basis, it predicts the output.

The system creates a model using labeled data to understand the datasets and learn about each data, once the training and processing are done then we test the model by providing a sample data to check whether it is predicting the exact output or not.The goal of supervised learning is to map input data with the output data. The supervised learning is based on supervision, and it is the same as when a student learns things in the supervision of the teacher. The example of supervised learning is spam filtering.

Supervised learning can be grouped further in two categories of algorithms:

    1. Classification
    2. Regression

### Unsupervised Learning
Unsupervised learning is a learning method in which a machine learns without any supervision.

The training is provided to the machine with the set of data that has not been labeled, classified, or categorized, and the algorithm needs to act on that data without any supervision. The goal of unsupervised learning is to restructure the input data into new features or a group of objects with similar patterns. In unsupervised learning, we don't have a predetermined result. The machine tries to find useful insights from the huge amount of data. It can be further classifieds into two categories of algorithms:

    1. Clustering
    2. Association
    
### Reinforcement Learning
Reinforcement learning is a feedback-based learning method, in which a learning agent gets a reward for each right action and gets a penalty for each wrong action. The agent learns automatically with these feedbacks and improves its performance. In reinforcement learning, the agent interacts with the environment and explores it. The goal of an agent is to get the most reward points, and hence, it improves its performance.

The robotic dog, which automatically learns the movement of his arms, is an example of Reinforcement learning.
