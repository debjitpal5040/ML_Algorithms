## What is a dataset?

A dataset is a collection of data in which data is arranged in some order. A dataset can contain any data from a series of an array to a database table. 

A tabular dataset can be understood as a database table or matrix, where each column corresponds to a particular variable, and each row corresponds to the fields of the dataset. The most supported file type for a tabular dataset is "Comma Separated File," or CSV. But to store a "tree-like data," we can use the JSON file more efficiently.

## Types of Data in Datasets

- <b>Numerical data</b> :- Such as house price, temperature, etc.
- <b>Categorical data</b> :- Such as Yes/No, True/False, Blue/green, etc.
- <b>Ordinal data</b> :- These data are similar to categorical data but can be measured on the basis of comparison.

## Need of Datasets

To work with machine learning projects, we need a huge amount of data, because, without the data, one cannot train ML/AI models. Collecting and preparing the dataset is one of the most crucial parts while creating an ML/AI project.

The technology applied behind any ML projects cannot work properly if the dataset is not well prepared and pre-processed.

During the development of the ML project, the developers completely rely on the datasets. In building ML applications, datasets are divided into two parts:

- <b>Training dataset
- Test Dataset</b>
