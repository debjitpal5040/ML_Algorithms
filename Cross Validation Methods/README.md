# Cross Validation Techniques

Cross validation is a technique that is widely used in machine learning to evaluate the performance of a model and to select the best parameters. In this blog post, we will explain what cross validation is, why it is useful, and how to implement some common cross validation methods in Python.

What is cross validation?

Cross validation is a process of splitting a dataset into two subsets: a training set and a test set. The training set is used to train a model, and the test set is used to evaluate how well the model generalizes to unseen data. The goal of cross validation is to estimate how well the model would perform on new data that is not part of the original dataset.

Why use cross validation?

Cross validation has several advantages over using a single split of the data:

- It reduces the variance of the performance estimate. By using multiple splits of the data, we can get a more reliable estimate of the model's performance than using a single split, which may be influenced by random factors.
- It allows us to use more data for training. By using different subsets of the data for training and testing, we can make use of all the available data and avoid wasting valuable information.
- It helps to prevent overfitting. Overfitting occurs when a model learns too much from the training data and fails to generalize to new data. By using cross validation, we can detect if a model is overfitting by comparing its performance on the training set and the test set. If the model performs much better on the training set than on the test set, it is likely overfitting.

How to implement cross validation?

There are different ways to implement cross validation, depending on how we split the data into subsets. Some common methods are:

- K-fold method: This is a more robust form of cross validation, where we divide the data into k equal-sized folds (or subsets). We then use one fold as the test set and the remaining k-1 folds as the training set. We repeat this process k times, each time using a different fold as the test set. We then average the performance scores across all k folds to get an overall estimate. This method ensures that every data point is used for both training and testing, and that each fold is used as the test set once. However, this method may be computationally expensive if k is large or if the model is complex.
- Leave-one-out method: This is a special case of k-fold method, where k equals to the number of data points. In other words, we use each data point as the test set and the remaining data points as the training set. We then average the performance scores across all data points to get an overall estimate. This method gives us the most unbiased estimate of the model's performance, but it may be very computationally intensive if the dataset is large.

## Stratified K-Fold Cross-Validation

Stratified k-fold cross-validation is a variation of k-fold cross-validation that preserves the class distribution in each fold. This means that each fold will have the same proportion of samples from each class as the original dataset. This is useful when we have imbalanced classes, as it ensures that we do not have folds that are dominated by one class or lack samples from another class.

The steps of stratified k-fold cross-validation are:

- Divide the dataset into k equally sized subsets (folds).
- For each fold, use it as the test set and use the remaining k-1 folds as the training set.
- Train and evaluate the machine learning model on each combination of training and test sets.
- Compute the average performance score over the k trials.

Here is an example of how stratified k-fold cross-validation works with a dataset of 6 samples and 2 classes:

| Sample | Class |
|--------|-------|
| 1      | 0     |
| 2      | 0     |
| 3      | 1     |
| 4      | 1     |
| 5      | 0     |
| 6      | 1     |

We can divide this dataset into 3 folds:

| Fold 1 | Fold 2 | Fold 3 |
|--------|--------|--------|
| 1, 3   | 2, 4   | 5, 6   |

Notice that each fold has one sample from each class, so the class distribution is preserved.

We can then use each fold as a test set and the rest as a training set:

| Trial | Training Set | Test Set |
|-------|--------------|----------|
| 1     | Fold 2 + 3   | Fold 1   |
| 2     | Fold 1 + 3   | Fold 2   |
| 3     | Fold 1 + 2   | Fold 3   |

We can train and evaluate our model on each trial and compute the average performance score.

## Leave-P-Out Cross-Validation

Leave-p-out cross-validation is another variation of cross-validation that leaves out p samples from the dataset as the test set and uses the remaining samples as the training set. This is repeated for all possible combinations of p samples, so that every sample is used exactly once as a test sample.

The steps of leave-p-out cross-validation are:

- Choose a value for p (the number of samples to leave out).
- For each possible combination of p samples, use them as the test set and use the rest of the samples as the training set.
- Train and evaluate the machine learning model on each combination of training and test sets.
- Compute the average performance score over all trials.

Here is an example of how leave-p-out cross-validation works with a dataset of 6 samples and p = 2:

| Sample |
|--------|
| A      |
| B      |
| C      |
| D      |
| E      |
| F      |

We can leave out any two samples as a test set and use the rest as a training set:

| Trial | Training Set | Test Set |
|-------|--------------|----------|
| 1     | C, D, E, F   | A, B     |
| 2     | B, D, E, F   | A, C     |
| 3     | B, C, E, F   | A, D     |
| ...   | ...          | ...      |
| 15    | A, B, C, D   | E, F     |

We can train and evaluate our model on each trial and compute the average performance score.


In Python, we can use libraries such as scikit-learn or TensorFlow to implement cross validation easily. For example, scikit-learn provides functions such as `train_test_split`, `KFold`, and `LeaveOneOut` to split the data into subsets. It also provides functions such as `cross_val_score` and `cross_validate` to evaluate the model's performance using cross validation.

Conclusion

Cross validation is a powerful technique that can help us assess and improve our machine learning models. By using different splits of the data for training and testing, we can get a more accurate and reliable estimate of how well our model would perform on new data. We can also use cross validation to compare different models or parameters and select the best one for our problem.
