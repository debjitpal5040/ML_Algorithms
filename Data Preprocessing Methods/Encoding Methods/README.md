# Encoding Methods

## Data Preprocessing Encoding Methods

In data preprocessing, encoding methods are used to convert categorical data into a numerical format that can be used by machine learning algorithms. Below are some common encoding methods:

### 1. Label Encoding
Label Encoding converts each unique category in a feature to a numerical label. This method is suitable for ordinal data where the categories have an inherent order.

### 2. One-Hot Encoding
One-Hot Encoding creates a new binary column for each unique category in a feature. Each column corresponds to a category, and a value of 1 or 0 indicates the presence or absence of that category. This method is suitable for nominal data where the categories do not have an inherent order.


### Usage
The choice of encoding method depends on the nature of the categorical data and the specific requirements of the machine learning model. It is important to experiment with different encoding methods to determine which one works best for your dataset.
